# Headcode CMS

Headcode CMS is a 100% open-source headless CMS. It does not require a separate CMS server or cloud service. Simply embed it into your Next.js 13 project - configure Supabase for database, storage, and Auth - and you are DONE! Future versions will support additional front-end frameworks and cloud services.
